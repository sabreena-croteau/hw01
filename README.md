#### *About Me*
I just finished my second year in the Political Science PhD program and my third year of UChicago graduate education overall (having completed MAPSS prior to the PhD). I mainly focus on the Political Economy of International Security, studying economic security concerns, economic power projection, weaponized interdependence, and oil politics. Going into my third year, I will be writing an MA thesis that I hope to incorporate into my dissertation, and then beginning the dissertation proposal.

I have completed my two comprehensive exams in substantive field (International relations as primary and comparative political as secondary) and am working towards the Social Sciences certificate in Quantitaive Methods. Most of the methodology classes I have taken assumed coding ability and concentrated heavily of mathematical concepts. While I feel strong in my understanding of the methods, my coding is quite weak and frequently caused me to struggle with the assignments for these courses (I knew what I wanted to do but could not figure out how to tell it to the computer). For these reasons, some part of this class will be repetitive for me, but I feel it is necessary to return to the building blocks, especially since coding in R does not come easy nor do I enjoy the puzzle of trying to figure it out (which is true when I am learning the mathematical side of working with data). But, I have heard very good things about the course from others who have taken it, so I am confident it will help me get back on track.

#### **How I Did This**
* Followed all the instructions on the course website. But, though the intructions were very clear, I didn't really understand what I was doing, just blindly following along
* So I had a friend that uses Git everyday walk through everything with me to explain everything, this was very helpful.
*Once I understood how to push and pull from Git just with the shell, I gave it a try in RStudio
*I also did find the [reference page](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow) to be very helpful
*This little [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) also helped as a reference


Well, there it is! My first pull request homework assignment attempt. Hope you like it!
